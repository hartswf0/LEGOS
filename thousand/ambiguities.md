# Ambiguities & Research Leads

## 1000 Lives Demo Unresolved Questions

### Turtle Host Fate
**Question:** What happened to the 1000 Lives Turtle Host after the demo failure?
- Did the tortoise survive the malfunction?
- Was Z's subplot data successfully erased or does it persist in the tortoise's brain?
- Is the Turtle Host the same individual as Thousand (Chalice's pet)?
- Was the tortoise euthanized, released, or kept in captivity post-failure?

**Canon Status:** No information available in wiki
**Inference:** Possible connection between 1000 Lives Turtle Host and Thousand (both tortoises, both connected to subplot/ZUBPLOTS carving)
**Research Leads:** Check exhibition materials, Ian Cheng interviews about continuity between works

### Exact Apartment Inventory (Thousand Lives)
**Question:** Complete list of all objects in Chalice's apartment simulation?
- Definitive count and types of objects
- Placement and spatial organization
- Which objects are static vs. dynamic (spawning/despawning)

**Canon Status:** Partial - grapes, pellets, urchins, bottles, jars confirmed
**Inference:** Exhibition may have full asset list
**Research Leads:** Contact production designer Shuruq Tramontini, review exhibition documentation

### Telemetry Field Names
**Question:** Exact names and parameters shown on Thousand's monitoring screen?
- Metabolism parameters (hunger, hydration, energy, etc.)
- Belief representation format
- Emotion state labels ("neutral", "joy", "fear", "anger" confirmed)
- Goal syntax ("eat / grapes green" format confirmed)

**Canon Status:** Partial naming conventions visible in screenshots
**Research Leads:** High-resolution exhibition photos, technical documentation

### Permadroned Years Internal Experience
**Question:** What did Chalice's consciousness experience during 10-year entrapment?
- Time dilation: did 10 years feel like 10 years, eternity, or instant?
- Was she in Z's subplot simulations or separate space?
- Could she observe Chyna Horchow living her life?
- Memory retention upon emergence?

**Canon Status:** Minimal canonical detail
**Inference:** Likely experienced subjective time distortion, observation of BOB-controlled life
**Research Leads:** Life After BOB wiki deeper entries, interviews about Chalice's arc

### Security Bug Mechanism
**Question:** How exactly did the security features fail?
- Technical nature of the bug (neural feedback loop? encryption failure?)
- Why did it injure Dr. Wong specifically?
- Why did it trap Chalice but not other participants (Princess Wendy, Orlando, Commander Alan)?
- Could failure be replicated or was it unique circumstance?

**Canon Status:** "buggy security features" with no technical detail
**Research Leads:** ZIM technical documentation within fiction, parallel to Unity security issues

### 1000 Plots Technical Improvements
**Question:** How did Chalice fix the security issues for 1000 Plots?
- Specific code refactoring details
- New security protocols
- Volunteer consent mechanism
- Success rate and user adoption post-launch

**Canon Status:** Only "refactored codebase" mentioned
**Inference:** Ethical consent model, personalized rather than universal demo data
**Research Leads:** 1000 Plots wiki page if it exists separately

## Thousand Lives Simulation Questions

### Angel Demon Dynamics
**Question:** Exact algorithm for parental influence vs. autonomous demons?
- How do viewer-provided captions weight against learned beliefs?
- Angel demon urgency calculation
- Integration vs. rejection thresholds
- Multi-viewer conflict resolution

**Canon Status:** Partial - angels compete with demons, success integrates caption
**Research Leads:** BOB Shrine documentation, technical papers on neuro-symbolic architecture

### Reincarnation Selection
**Question:** How is the 20% belief retention determined?
- Random selection? Priority-based? Recency-weighted?
- Which beliefs are most likely to persist?
- Does emotional valence affect retention?

**Canon Status:** "about 20 percent" - mechanism unspecified
**Inference:** Likely randomized with possible epigenetic weighting
**Research Leads:** Richard Evans' paper on learning, Ian Cheng technical talks

### Viewer Intervention Effects
**Question:** Do wiki edits loop back into simulation world state?
- If viewer edits wiki entry, does that change simulation behavior?
- Worldwatching as read-only vs. read-write
- Community canon formation mechanism

**Canon Status:** "open-source platform that allows viewers to create and edit entries"
**Inference:** Likely read-only for immediate simulation, influences future iterations
**Research Leads:** Worldwatching technical documentation, interview about collaborative worldbuilding

### Death Frequency
**Question:** How often does Thousand die and reincarnate?
- Average lifetime duration before death
- Most common death causes (poison, starvation, injury, Chalice disruption)
- Does death rate change as beliefs accumulate across lives?

**Canon Status:** "dies repeatedly" but no frequency data
**Research Leads:** Exhibition observation logs, simulation analytics if available

## World Model Architecture Questions

### Unity Implementation Details
**Question:** Specific Unity packages and scripts used?
- Custom AI agents vs. Unity ML-Agents
- Neural network implementation (TensorFlow? PyTorch? Custom?)
- Real-time inference performance optimization

**Canon Status:** "Built in Unity" confirmed, specifics unknown
**Research Leads:** Technical documentation, open-source code if released, developer interviews

### Richard Evans Integration
**Question:** How directly is Evans' 2017 paper implemented?
- Direct use of Evans' algorithm or modified version?
- Training data requirements
- Rule induction computational cost

**Canon Status:** "Based on Richard Evans' 2017 paper" confirmed
**Research Leads:** Evans' original paper comparison, Cheng technical documentation

### Procedural Body Growth (BOB-specific)
**Question:** Ball-spring node network parameters?
- Number of nodes
- Spring constants and damping
- Growth rules and morphology constraints
- Locomotion emergence mechanism

**Canon Status:** "Procedurally grown network of spring-mass nodes" confirmed
**Research Leads:** BOB technical specifications, earlier Emissary trilogy documentation

## Aesthetic Questions

### Red Lighting Triggers
**Question:** When exactly does red lighting intensify?
- Specific demon activations?
- Arousal thresholds?
- Valence extremes?
- Time of simulated day?

**Canon Status:** "Rich saturated reds during sunrise/sunset, emotional intensity"
**Inference:** Tied to both temporal cycles and emotional states
**Research Leads:** Exhibition observation across multiple sessions

### Glowing Effect Implementation
**Question:** Technical rendering of glowing effects?
- Shader implementation
- Triggered by what events (new object, surprise, goal achievement)?
- Duration and decay parameters

**Canon Status:** Described but not technically specified
**Research Leads:** Unity shader documentation, exhibition technical rider

## Narrative Timeline Gaps

### Z's 2084 Appearance
**Question:** Details of Z's "brief puzzling appearance" at Double Destiny Wedding?
- What did he do or say?
- Why "puzzling"?
- Reaction from attendees?
- Does he still have influence over ZIM?

**Canon Status:** Mentioned but not detailed
**Research Leads:** Double Destiny Wedding wiki page, Z's character arc documentation

### Chyna Horchow Identity Philosophy
**Question:** Is Chyna a separate entity or Chalice's self-given name?
- Wiki says "self-given name of Chalice Wong when permadroned"
- Does this mean BOB believes itself to BE Chalice?
- Or separate identity using Chalice's body?

**Canon Status:** Ambiguous by design
**Inference:** Ontologically ambiguous - neither separate nor identical
**Research Leads:** Identity philosophy in Life After BOB, character analysis

---

**Methodology Notes:**
- Canon vs. Inference must be clearly tagged
- Each ambiguity should link to potential research leads
- Update this document as new information emerges
- Cross-reference with design_fill.md for speculative extensions

**Priority Research:**
1. Turtle Host fate and connection to Thousand
2. Permadroned Years subjective experience
3. Unity technical implementation details
4. Aesthetic trigger mechanisms
5. Chyna Horchow identity ontology
