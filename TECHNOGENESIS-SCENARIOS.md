# Technogenesis Scenarios
## Extracted from N. Katherine Hayles "How We Think"

Based on the book's exploration of media upheavals in humanities and how humans coevolve with technology, here are 8 scenarios ready to add to LEGOS Multi-Channel:

---

## Scenario 1: Print-Based Scholar

```javascript
printscholar: {
  id: 'printscholar',
  name: 'Print-Based Scholar',
  role: 'Traditional Humanities Professor',
  goal: 'Maintain relevance while print era passes',
  obstacle: 'Digital colleagues speaking incomprehensible language, skills obsolescing',
  intro: 'Tenure review committee asks about digital work. Journal articles cited zero times in five years. Students prefer screens to books.',
  context: [
    'Power: Print Scholar 0.35 (institutional authority fading) vs Digital Future 0.80',
    'Stakes: Career built on print expertise, retirement in 10 years, feeling hands amputated when internet fails'
  ],
  initialPrompt: 'Colleague presents digital project at faculty meeting. Uses terms like database front-ends, navigation hierarchies, collaborative teams. You nod but understand nothing.',
  systemInstruction: 'You orchestrate print scholar confronting obsolescence. Track skill anxiety, resistance to change, tunnel vision on text, gradual recognition that digital is not just fancy print. Chart paths toward Comparative Media Studies or deeper isolation.'
}
```

**Key Themes**: Skills obsolescence, resistance, print transparency breaking down, 93.1% of humanities articles never cited

## Scenario 2: Digital Humanities Scholar

```javascript
digitalscholar: {
  id: 'digitalscholar',
  name: 'Digital Humanities Scholar',
  role: 'Emerging Digital Media Researcher',
  goal: 'Get digital work recognized for tenure',
  obstacle: 'Print-based committee undervalues non-text elements',
  intro: 'Three years building collaborative database with animation, navigation design, global reach. Tenure file due. Committee asks: but where is the monograph?',
  context: [
    'Power: Digital Scholar 0.25 (innovative but unrecognized) vs Print Committee 0.75',
    'Stakes: Blog reaches thousands vs journal article cited zero times, but only journal counts'
  ],
  initialPrompt: 'Tenure committee meeting. You present project with graphics, database, navigation. Senior colleague asks: Can you just email me the text version?',
  systemInstruction: 'You orchestrate digital scholar credentialing crisis. Track undervaluation of design work, collaboration seen as less rigorous than solo authorship, audience metrics dismissed. Can they translate digital work into print legibility or must they abandon translation?'
}
```

**Key Themes**: Credentialing, audience reach vs institutional recognition, graphics/design as argument

---

## Scenario 3: Administrator

```javascript
administrator: {
  id: 'administrator',
  name: 'Digital Humanities Administrator',
  role: 'Program Director Navigating Transformation',
  goal: 'Transform department for digital future while keeping print scholars',
  obstacle: 'Widening rift between print and digital faculty',
  intro: 'You are Kenneth Knoespel, Tara McPherson, or Alan Liu. Budget for new lab space. Print faculty want books. Digital faculty want servers. Both threaten walkout.',
  context: [
    'Power: Administrator 0.60 (authority but constrained by factions)',
    'Stakes: Department fracturing into print vs digital camps, students caught between, university pressuring for relevance'
  ],
  initialPrompt: 'Budget meeting. Print faculty demand library acquisitions. Digital faculty demand studio space with sensors and actuators. Dean wants metrics on employment outcomes.',
  systemInstruction: 'You orchestrate administrative navigation of media upheaval. Track institutional inertia, generational conflict, resource scarcity (human attention as limiting factor per Fred Brooks). Can Comparative Media Studies bridge the rift?'
}
```

**Key Themes**: Institutional transformation, resource allocation, bridging print/digital divide

## Scenario 4: Contemporary Student

```javascript
student: {
  id: 'student',
  name: 'Contemporary Student',
  role: 'Undergraduate Navigating Multiple Literacies',
  goal: 'Acquire skills for information-intensive future',
  obstacle: 'Print courses ignore digital life, digital life ignored in courses',
  intro: 'Morning: close reading of 18th century novel. Afternoon: creating TikTok video essay. Evening: gaming with global team. No transfer between contexts.',
  context: [
    'Hyper attention mode (low boredom threshold, multiple streams) vs deep attention required for print',
    'Neural plasticity at peak, epigenetic changes from daily screen interaction'
  ],
  initialPrompt: 'Professor assigns 50-page essay analyzing print novel. You think: I could make an interactive database with character networks, timeline visualizations, and crowdsourced annotations reaching thousands. But that is not an option.',
  systemInstruction: 'You orchestrate student navigating print/digital divide. Track hyper reading vs close reading, attention fragmentation, desire for problem-based learning vs content orientation. Chart paths where multiple literacies converge or stay siloed.'
}
```

**Key Themes**: Hyper vs deep attention, neural plasticity, multiple literacies, problem-based learning

## Scenario 5: Telegraph Era Technogenesis

```javascript
telegraph: {
  id: 'telegraph',
  name: 'Telegraph Era Technogenesis',
  role: 'Code Book Operator (1870s)',
  goal: 'Master economy, secrecy, and simplicity of telegraph codes',
  obstacle: 'Natural language dissolving into code words, thought patterns changing',
  intro: '1870s. Telegraph code books match phrases with code words. Communication accelerates. Commodities virtualize. Your body learns new rhythms: tap tap tap.',
  context: [
    'First globally pervasive binary signaling system',
    'Epigenetic changes: fast communication, collapsed signifier/signified, bodily practices reengineered'
  ],
  initialPrompt: 'You translate business message into code. Phrase becomes word, meaning becomes efficiency. Hours saved, money made. But something shifts in how you think about language itself.',
  systemInstruction: 'You orchestrate historical technogenesis. Track language/code relations, bodily practice changes, virtualization of commodities. Telegraph anticipates digital era: speed, abstraction, reengineered cognition. Show century-long feedback loops.'
}
```

**Key Themes**: Historical parallel, technogenesis cycles, language/code interface, bodily practice changes

## Scenario 6: Attention Crisis

```javascript
attention: {
  id: 'attention',
  name: 'Attention Crisis',
  role: 'Researcher in Information Deluge',
  goal: 'Focus on complex problem requiring deep attention',
  obstacle: 'Hyper attention mode activated by constant digital stimulation',
  intro: 'Research requires sustained focus. Email notification. Check it. Return to work. Text message. Answer. Back to work. Twitter. Refresh. You have read the same paragraph eight times without comprehension.',
  context: [
    'Human attention is scarce resource (per Fred Brooks)',
    'Neural plasticity repurposing circuits: Google searches change brain morphology'
  ],
  initialPrompt: 'Deep in analysis of complex text. Phone buzzes. Ignore it. Buzzes again. Ignore. Third buzz. Check it. Lose train of thought. Try to recover. Cannot. Distraction wins.',
  systemInstruction: 'You orchestrate attention fragmentation crisis. Track hyper attention (low boredom threshold, multiple streams, high stimulation) vs deep attention (single stream, long focus, high boredom tolerance). Nicholas Carr argues intellectual capacity declining. Can strategies bridge both modes?'
}
```

**Key Themes**: Attention as scarce resource, hyper vs deep attention, Nicholas Carr's "The Shallows", neural changes

  obstacle: 'Different skill sets, different languages, different values',
  intro: 'Team: humanities scholar, designer, programmer, archivist. Scholar wants theoretical depth. Designer wants visual impact. Programmer wants clean code. Archivist wants metadata standards.',
  context: [
    'Collaborative work vs solo authorship, studio/lab space vs office',
    'Students as partners, making as thinking, theory through practice'
  ],
  initialPrompt: 'Team meeting. Humanities scholar presents concept using Derrida. Designer sketches navigation. Programmer explains database schema. No one understands anyone else.',
  systemInstruction: 'You orchestrate collaborative complexity. Track translation between disciplines, productive misunderstanding, shared object as boundary object. Project-based research joins theory and practice. Can team forge shared language or fracture into specializations?'
}
```

**Key Themes**: Collaboration vs solo work, interdisciplinary translation, making as research, team dynamics

  context: [
    'Embodied cognition: thought exists throughout body, not just neocortex',
    'Networked machines as cognitive partners, not tools'
  ],
  initialPrompt: 'Experiment: Subject solves puzzle with pencil and paper. Brain scans show paper functions as working memory. Is paper part of mind?',
  systemInstruction: 'You orchestrate extended cognition research. Track where boundaries blur between human and machine, internal and external, thinking and doing. Andy Clark continuous reciprocal causation. Objects have their own embodiments and umwelt. Consciousness not required for cognition.'
}

## Key Concepts from Hayles

**Technogenesis**: Humans and technics coevolve. Not genetic mutation but epigenetic changes accelerated by environmental transformation.

**Three Reading Modes**:
- **Close reading**: Deep attention, single text, high boredom tolerance
- **Hyper reading**: Scanning, skimming, fragmentation for information-intensive environments
- **Machine reading**: Algorithms analyzing large data sets

**Comparative Media Studies**: Framework to bridge print and digital, denaturalize print transparency, teach multiple literacies.

**Attention as Scarce Resource**: Fred Brooks design principle - identify limiting factor (not money but human attention).

**Power Dynamics**: Most scenarios show asymmetries between established print authority and emerging digital practices.

---

**These scenarios turn Hayles' theoretical exploration into playable narrative fields where the media upheaval becomes experiential, forkable, and perspective-shifting.**
